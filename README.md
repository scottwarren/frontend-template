### Frontend Template

Template used to create ready to go frontend projects with some opinionated defaults.

The point of the defaults/choices is to make it easier to start a project and to have a consistent structure across projects, rather than make any kind of statement regarding what is the best way to do things.

### Features

- React
- TypeScript
